Security Notes
==============

Protected resources should not be served up in /static
  Instead, make them a resource that gets served up by the application.
  
Put application-level passwords in the context.xml for your home directory.

Some passwords, etc. are in /conf/context.xml so this needs to be checked out
  so that any application can't just do a context crawl to get to the data.
