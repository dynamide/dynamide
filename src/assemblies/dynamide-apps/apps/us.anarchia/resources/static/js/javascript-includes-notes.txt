<!-- I tried RequireJS from 
           http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html
             but it caches stuff so badly that I had to restart
             dynamide server to get js updates, and even changing the included filename
             still went to retrieve the old file.  Might be a problem in dynamide caching, 
             but just using script tags never caused a problem before, so not using this now.
         
         I then tried require.js from 
           http://pixelsvsbytes.com/blog/2013/02/js-require-for-browsers-better-faster-stronger/
             and it works thusly, but of course makes everything a module, so I'd have to 
             start using export.foo...
                <script src="/tagonomy/js/require.js"></script>
                <script>
                    var mymod = require('/tagonomy/js/jsonEditor.js');
                </script>
        So for now, it is back to script tags. :)
