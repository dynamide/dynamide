<P>&quot;event&quot; object</P>
<P>The event object contains information about the current ServerSide
Event. You can get information about the CGI parameters sent from the
browser, the client's browser and platform, and the client's Session
object.  Most importantly, you can set the results of the event
through this object.  ServerSide Event handlers do not have a return
value &#150; instead you set the result properties of the event
object.</P>
