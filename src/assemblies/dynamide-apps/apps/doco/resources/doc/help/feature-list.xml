<PRE>
All pages are dynamically generated

Sessions remember user state
Sessions have Fields, which carry across Pages
Fields can be wired to any kind of datasource
There is a Widget for automatically processing XSLT
All Widgets are data-aware
There are Widgets for many kinds of input
  Extended HTML controls
    Edit, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Button, Submit, Checkbox
  Compound Controls
    Chooser, DataGrid, Breadcrumbs, Callout, Tree, TabbedNotebook
You can create your own custom Widgets
You can create Application-specific Widgets in WYSIWYG mode
Dynamide automatically handles page flow, and lets you manipulate page flow in various ways
There is a full event model for hooking into precisely the event you wish to capture,
  rather than having to create a Web Application framework for each new application.
Development, Deployment, and Versioning are managed with developer and staging sandboxes

  Dynamide has sandboxes and per-Application search paths
  so that the correct overrides are picked up in development, Q/A and production.  Multiple developers
  can work on the same Dynamide host with different user sandboxes and share or segregate code as desired.
