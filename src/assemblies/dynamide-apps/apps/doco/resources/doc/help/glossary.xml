    <text>
    An assembly is a directory for your project.  Assemblies organize your applications for source control
    and deployment.  Users have no perception of Assemblies.  Currently,
    the Assembliy setup is automatic.  If you specify a Assembly name that is not in
    use, Dynamide will create that Assembly when you create the first project.  Assemblies
    allow you to easily share libraries of components between a group of applications.
    Physically, an Assembly is a zip file or directory
    containing an assembly.xml file in the root, and all required resources
    to  define a set of applications or to define a library.

    <caption id="Application">Application</caption>

    <text>An application is a series of web pages that serve a common purpose.
     You can have multiple applications within an <a href='#Assembly'>Assembly</a>.  Applications
    always start with the same URI, such as <code>/myapp</code>  or <code>/foo/myOtherApp</code>.

    <caption id="Session">Session</caption>

    <text>When a user uses an application, they get a Session until
    the Session times out. (The timeout is configurable.)  All values in the Session
    are saved in memory on the webserver until the application decides to persist
    them.  Multiple users using the same URI would get multiple Sessions.
     Sessions are usefull for remembering user state, such as shopping cart fields.
     Valuable data should be persisted to a datastore, but the Session can
    pool datastore connections, etc.

    <caption id="Page">Page</caption>

    <text>A Page object produces a web page.  The contents of the web page can be dynamically
    altered by Dynamide and your application code.  You can have an application with one Page object that
    is modified by the data available and the user's actions.  When the Page's contents are very different,
    it is best to design a separate Page object for each base page, and use Dynamide's page flow features to present the pages
    in the correct order.  Pages are defined in XML files in the application directory.  The file contains
    elements for Page properties, HTML source, ServerSide Events, and properties of Widgets dropped on the page.

    <caption id="Widget">Widget</caption>

    <text>A Widget is a component that contains a layout template, properties, and method.
    Widgets are added to Pages.  They can be coded by hand, or built using the Dynamide IDE.

    <caption id="URI">URI</caption>

    <text>
    A URI is the path portion of a URL. For example, given the URL
    <code>        http://myhost:80/foo/bar?param=value</code>
    the URI is
    <code>        /foo/bar</code>
    </text>

    <caption id="Monolythic Assembly">Monolythic Assembly</caption>

    <text>All the resources needed to run everything in an assembly -- an assembly that requires no
    imports.  Does not include Java jar files. To create a file with
    all required  jar files, create a WAR file from a Monolythic Assembly.  See also: <a href='#Assembly'>Assembly</a>

    <text> standard J2EE <B>W</B>eb <B>AR</B>chive.  Contains
    all the files needed to deploy a web application to a J2EE application server.
     These include the resource files plus all required Java jar files.
