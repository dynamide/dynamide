<P>Wrappers for datatypes found in property elements in resource files.  For example,
a Widget can have a value property, and the value could be a String, which is the default,
or it could be an Integer, Caption or Link.  For types other than the default, the property
must specify the class of the datatype.  These classes are those concrete classes
referenced, and all extend com.dynamide.Datatype, com.dynamide.EnumeratedDatatype
or com.dynamide.ExpandableDatatype.  To make your own datatype, you must write a wrapper
and extend one of these base classes.
