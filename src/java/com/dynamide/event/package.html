<P>Event objects for GUI events and for server side script events.
ChangeEvents are used extensively in the com.dynamide.gui classes, but not elsewhere.
ScriptEvents are the heart of the Dynamide ServerSideEvents, which get fired on the
server when different events occur.  The ScriptEvent is passed in to all event
handlers.
