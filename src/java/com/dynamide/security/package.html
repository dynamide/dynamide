<P>Security objects, for preventing unauthorized access to resources across Dynamide Assemblies, Sessions, etc.
There are many security features in dynamide, most of which are best described in the
Dynamide "doco" application.  If you have it installed on this server, you can see
it here:
<br/>
<A HREF="/dynamide/doco/doc/help/security">Security</A>
<br/>
Otherwise, you can see it here:

<br/>

<p>
The core classes in this package restrict access and implement security policies:
<UL>
  <LI>DynamideSecurityManager - installed as the Java VM SecurityManager, polices all access.</LI>
  <LI>HackerSecurityManager - test case to make sure another SecurityManager can't be installed</LI>
  <LI>DynamideClassLoader - the one and only ClassLoader allowed</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<p>
These classes participate in authentication and authorization:
<UL>
  <LI>Group -</LI>
  <LI>User -</LI>
</UL>
</p>
