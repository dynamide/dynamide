<P>The core of the Dynamide Framework: Session, Widget, Page, Property, etc.
To build a web application in Dynamide, you create Application, Session
Widget, Page and Property entities.  The classes in this package represent the runtime version
of those objects.  Using the Dynamide API, you can manipulate all of these entities in memory,
and, if you have permission, cause each entity to persist itself to a resource
(such as an XML file on disk).   The entities can be created entirely from the API.
There are Beanshell scripts to show how this is done in the scripts directory of the
distribution, and there is a DHTML Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that runs
on an Internet Explorer client and manipulates the API on a remote server.  This
is a Dynamide application, called "ide", and, if available on your installation,
is accessible via the URI /dynamide/ide .  There
is also a Java Swing GUI (in the com.dynamide.gui package) that manipulates the API, but it is under development.
