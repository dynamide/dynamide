<P>Classes for accessing resources from Dynamide.
All resource requests in Dynamide must go through the Dynamide ResourceManager.
This class will make calls to the com.dynamide.security.DynamideSecurityManager to
see if the action is allowed.  Things like socket resources are denied in Hosted Mode.
Direct file access through the java.io.File constructors is dissallowed.  To read a file
you must use the Dynamide ResourceManager, and have permissions on the target file.
</P>

<P>
Persistent resources can be stored in Assemblies, which can be physically represented
by zip files or file directories.  Widgets, applications, and pages can all be persisted
in Assemblies.  The Assemblies are represented by the Assembly class.  Each Assembly
is an IContext containing IContext nodes for each resource.  Assembly IContexts also
participate in an IContext tree of Assemblies.
</P>

<P>
Stored in the Assemblies are web-apps.xml resources, which describe the applications
present in an Assembly for deployment.  These are represented by the WebApps class,
and the WebAppEntry record, and get transformed into an IContext tree of WebApps.
</P>
