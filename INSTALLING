Steps to installing dynamide as a developer.
====================================

Prerequisites:
  - Java
  - Ant
  - Tomcat, installed in ${CATALINA_HOME} and config files in ${CATALINA_BASE}
        - Make sure Tomcat has at least run once, and that you can get to it. 
          Just running Tomcat sets up some directories under  ${CATALINA_HOME} 
          If you haven't done this yet, run and stop Tomcat now:
               ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/startup.sh
               ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/shutdown.sh
  
Installation:          
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/dynamide/dynamide.git
    cd dynamide
    ant 
    ant install-bin
    cp ./build/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/* ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/Catalina/localhost/
    
Start Tomcat:
    ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/startup.sh
    
Browse to: 
        http://localhost:8080/dynamide/doco
    
To run command-line utilities, export this environment variable to where you put dynamide:
    export DYNAMIDE_HOME=/home/laramie/dynamide

If you want to change the output directories, or fiddle with your tomcat setup, look at this file:
    vi ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}/dynamide.local.properties
