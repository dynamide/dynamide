Steps to installing dynamide as a developer.
====================================

dynamide needs an admin-facing installation script and instructions.
This file is NOT that file.
This file tells you how to install from source and get a build working.
After that, you would follow INSTALLING-tomcat.txt except that that file is just notes right now.

Here's how you get a source distribution, customize the properties file, and then do a build.

Prerequisites:
  Java
  Ant
  svn

Developer Installation Instructions
====================================
In these instructions, I have a src directory where I keep all my projects 
under my home dir.  You can have it elsewhere.  The directory you check out 
is called dynamide by default.  So just change /Users/laramie/src to whatever you want.
The rest of the instructions should be generic.
====================================

cd /Users/laramie/src

svn co https://dynamie.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dynamide dynamide

export DYNAMIDE_HOME=/Users/laramie/src/dynamide

cd ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}

cp ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}/bin/dynamide.local.properties.template ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}/dynamide.local.properties

## In this next file, you want to change some variables.  
## Read the notes there.
## Specifically, you need to change these two lines for your system and uncomment them:
## DYNAMIDE_LOGS=/Users/laramie/tmp/dynamide-logs
## JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home

vi ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}/dynamide.local.properties

ant compile javadoc dist zip install-bin homes


## From here, you would pull down tomcat and follow the instructions 
## in ./INSTALLING-tomcat.xml
