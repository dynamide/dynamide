Steps to installing dynamide as a developer.
====================================

Prerequisites:
  - Java
  - Ant
  - Tomcat, installed in ${DM_TOMCAT_HOME}
        - DM_TOMCAT_HOME is defined in dynamide.local.properties
        - It is the same as CATALINA_HOME, the base of your apache-tomcat installation
        - Tested with Tomcat 7
        - If you have a more complicated tomcat setup, like separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE,
           then please read doc/installing-tomcat-notes.txt
  
Installation:          
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/dynamide/dynamide.git
    cd dynamide
    vi dynamide.local.properties
    ant 
    
    Note:  This installs context files in ${DM_TOMCAT_HOME}/conf/Catalina/localhost/
                  which will take over the ROOT (the default webapp).   
             Alternatively, you can copy the context elements in the fragment: 
                 ${DYNAMIDE_HOME}/build/tomcat/conf/server-fragment.xml 
             into the Host element of 
                 ${DM_TOMCAT_HOME}/conf/server.xml
    
Start Tomcat:
    export CATALINA_OPTS= -Xmx3072m
    ${DM_TOMCAT_HOME}/bin/startup.sh
    
Browse to: 
        http://localhost:8080/dynamide/doco
    
To run command-line utilities, point this environment variable to where you put dynamide, e.g.:
    export DYNAMIDE_HOME=/home/laramie/dynamide
